# Different to release-pypi-win.cmd and release-pypi-osx.sh,
# this script has to be ran from a clean dockerfile

# Random note: The reason why this script is being ran from within a container
# is to ensure glibc compatibility. From what I've seen so far, it appears
# that having multiple glibc versions is a somewhat convoluted process
# and I don't trust myself to be able to manage them well.
